# CryptoCrunch

CryptoCrunch is an open source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities. CryptoCrunch can dynamically unify data from disparate sources and normalize the data into destinations of your choice. Cleanse and democratize all your data for diverse advanced downstream analytics and visualization use cases.

CryptoCrunch polls JSON output from APIs and transforms the ouput of those APIs into consitently formed objects through your input, filter, and output plugins. Modify your plugins so the output conforms to your required NoSQL schema, pipe the output directly into log files, or post that content to a web service.
